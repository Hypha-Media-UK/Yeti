# Feature Status

This document tracks the implementation status of all features in the Staff Rota Application.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### Core Rota Management
- **Staff Management** - Create, edit, delete staff members (Regular, Relief, Supervisor)
- **Rotation Scheduling** - Automatic 8-day and 16-day rotation cycles
- **Days Offset** - Stagger staff rotations using days offset
- **Manual Assignments** - Override automatic rotations with manual assignments
- **Shift Groups** - Day and Night shift assignments

### Location Hierarchy
- **Buildings** - Create and manage building locations
- **Departments** - Create departments within buildings
- **Include in Main Rota** - Flag departments for display on main rota screen

### Service Areas
- **Services** - Create and manage service areas (independent of buildings)
- **Include in Main Rota** - Flag services for display on main rota screen

### Staff Allocations
- **Many-to-Many Allocations** - Staff can be allocated to multiple departments and/or services
- **Allocation Management** - Bulk set allocations per staff member

### Operational Hours
- **Department Operational Hours** - Define when departments are operational
- **Service Operational Hours** - Define when services are operational
- **Multiple Time Ranges** - Support for split shifts (e.g., 08:00-12:00 and 14:00-18:00)
- **Midnight Crossing** - Support for shifts crossing midnight (e.g., 22:00-06:00)
- **ISO 8601 Days** - Monday=1 through Sunday=7

### Contracted Hours
- **Staff Contracted Hours** - Define contracted working days and hours for each staff member
- **Same Structure as Operational Hours** - Supports multiple ranges and midnight crossing

### Data Management
- **Soft Deletes** - All entities use `is_active` flag for data preservation
- **Cascade Deletes** - Proper cleanup of related data (e.g., contracted hours when staff deleted)
- **Duplicate Prevention** - UNIQUE constraints and frontend deduplication

### UI/UX
- **Tabbed Interface** - Clean navigation between Staff, Locations, and Services
- **Modal Dialogs** - Consistent modal patterns for create/edit operations
- **Accordion UI** - Expandable department editing in BuildingModal
- **Reusable Components** - OperationalHoursEditor, BaseModal, BaseTabs, etc.
- **Confirmation Dialogs** - Confirm before deleting entities

## üöß Planned Features (Not Yet Implemented)

### Fixed Schedules
**Status:** Database schema exists, backend API exists, but no UI implementation

**Description:**
Fixed schedules allow certain staff members to work specific days regardless of the rotation cycle. This is useful for staff who have permanent day-off patterns or fixed working days.

**Database Table:** `fixed_schedules`
- `id` - Primary key
- `staff_id` - Foreign key to staff table
- `day_of_week` - Day of week (1-7)
- `is_working` - Boolean flag (true = working, false = day off)

**Backend API:**
- Repository: `backend/src/repositories/schedule.repository.ts`
- Controller method: `staff.controller.ts` has `deleteSchedule` method
- Route: `DELETE /api/rota/schedules/:id` (in rota.routes.ts)

**What's Missing:**
- UI to create/edit fixed schedules
- Integration with rota calculation logic
- Display of fixed schedules in staff management

**Priority:** Medium - Useful for edge cases but not critical for core functionality

### Copy Hours Functionality
**Status:** Backend API fully implemented, frontend UI removed (was placeholder)

**Description:**
Allow users to copy operational hours from one department/service to another, or copy contracted hours from one staff member to another.

**Backend API:**
- `POST /api/operational-hours/copy` - Copy operational hours between areas
- `POST /api/contracted-hours/copy` - Copy contracted hours between staff

**What's Missing:**
- Modal UI to select source department/service/staff
- Integration with OperationalHoursEditor component
- "Copy from..." button functionality

**Priority:** Low - Nice-to-have feature for convenience

### Advanced Rota Features
**Status:** Not started

**Potential Features:**
- Rota templates (save and reuse common patterns)
- Bulk manual assignments (assign multiple staff at once)
- Rota export (PDF, Excel, CSV)
- Rota printing with custom layouts
- Email notifications for shift assignments
- Mobile app for viewing rotas
- Shift swap requests
- Leave/absence management
- Overtime tracking
- Compliance checking (max hours, rest periods)

**Priority:** Varies - To be prioritized based on user feedback

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Production)
1. ‚úÖ Remove non-functional "Copy Hours" buttons (DONE)
2. ‚úÖ Code audit and cleanup (DONE)
3. Test all features end-to-end
4. Performance testing with realistic data volumes
5. Security audit
6. Backup and restore procedures

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. Decide on Fixed Schedules feature (implement or remove)
2. Implement Copy Hours UI (if desired)
3. Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
4. Database query optimization
5. Bundle size analysis and optimization

### Long Term (Future Releases)
1. Gather user feedback on current features
2. Prioritize advanced features based on user needs
3. Consider mobile app development
4. Explore integration with HR systems
5. Add reporting and analytics

## üìù Notes

- All core features required for basic rota management are implemented and working
- The application is production-ready for its current scope
- Fixed schedules and copy hours are optional enhancements
- Advanced features should be prioritized based on actual user needs
