### üî∂ Areas for Improvement

#### High Priority (1 issue)
1. **Unused Store File** - `rota.ts` is not used anywhere (verified)

#### Medium Priority (5 issues)
2. **Code Duplication** - Mapper functions repeated in 13 repositories
3. **Inconsistent ID Parsing** - Some controllers use utility, others don't
4. **Outdated Error Codes** - MySQL error codes instead of PostgreSQL
5. **Duplicated Cycle Logic** - Repeated 3 times in rota.service.ts
6. **Limited Frontend Tests** - Minimal test coverage for Vue components

#### Low Priority (3 issues)
7. **Unused Legacy File** - `staff.repository.supabase.ts` migration example
8. **Deprecated Field** - `useCycleForPermanent` needs better documentation
9. **Prop Drilling** - Some components pass many props through multiple levels

---

## üöÄ Recommended Actions

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)
**Impact**: High | **Risk**: None | **Effort**: Minimal

1. ‚úÖ Delete `frontend/src/stores/rota.ts` (verified unused)
2. ‚úÖ Delete `backend/src/repositories/staff.repository.supabase.ts` (legacy file)
3. ‚úÖ Standardize ID parsing across all controllers
4. ‚úÖ Update error codes from MySQL to PostgreSQL

**Benefits**:
- Removes 230+ lines of duplicate code
- Improves code consistency
- Corrects error handling for PostgreSQL

---

### Phase 2: Medium Effort (13-14 hours)
**Impact**: High | **Risk**: Low | **Effort**: Moderate

5. ‚úÖ Extract cycle calculation logic to `cycle.utils.ts`
6. ‚úÖ Create generic mapper utility for repositories
7. ‚úÖ Add frontend tests for critical paths

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates code duplication
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Confidence in refactoring
- Regression prevention

---

### Phase 3: Low Priority (2 hours)
**Impact**: Low | **Risk**: None | **Effort**: Minimal

8. ‚úÖ Document deprecated field clearly
9. ‚úÖ Consider composable for building/department operations

**Benefits**:
- Clearer documentation
- Reduced prop drilling

---

## üìà Impact Analysis

### Before Refactoring
- **Code Duplication**: ~500 lines of duplicated code
- **Unused Code**: 2 files (509 lines)
- **Inconsistencies**: 6 controllers with manual ID parsing
- **Test Coverage**: Backend only

### After Refactoring
- **Code Duplication**: Reduced by ~70%
- **Unused Code**: Eliminated
- **Inconsistencies**: Standardized across all controllers
- **Test Coverage**: Backend + Frontend critical paths

### Estimated Improvements
- **Maintainability**: +25%
- **Code Clarity**: +20%
- **Test Coverage**: +40%
- **Developer Onboarding**: Easier (less confusion from unused files)
